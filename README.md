# Air flights Scraper
 Air flights scraper is a project to scrap the datasets of flights around the airports of the world, accessing on its source and destination airport. It establishes a connection between the source and destination airport per single flight to detect the airplanes routes, in order to determine at the end which airport is the most important according to number of landings. The software looks for datasets first, selects one to web scrape, and then arranges the data for preview. Following that, the data is linked together, and a network frame of nodes and edges is drawn. Next, it analyses this network to calculate each node's degree and betweenness centrality in order to identify the most important airport. Next, using the KDE concept to plot a heatmap based on the locations of each airport in the world map. Lastly, it plots the 2D relationship network in 3D to make the nodes and edges seem like a 3D model. The Tkinter library is used to include all of these characteristics into a graphical user interface, which gives the program a preview.
